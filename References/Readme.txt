Add your references to the bib file in this folder. I have included one item "ploner2005" for example. 

Let's follow the following format in naming of each entry to avoid duplication:

firstauthorname followed by year of publication

If there are more than one papers in the same year by the same first author, we can add letters "b", "c", "d", ... for the second, third, fourth,... such papers. For example, 2 other papers by Ploner in 2005 will have item names ploner2005b and ploner2005c. 

It should be easy to do a quick search before adding, for example, ploner2005b to see if ploner2005 exists and if it is different from ploner2005b.
